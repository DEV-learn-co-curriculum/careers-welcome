# Welcome to Career Prep

You just learned tons of new technical stuff, and now you’re equipped with the skills to make you a junior developer. This next track will guide you through the process that will end with a job offer. Know that it will be really hard, and that’s why we have set up this track like a roadmap to prepare you for what’s to come. We know what it takes to get a developer job because we’ve done this with over 1,500 students over the past five years. That’s why we’ve set up the [Career Services Commitment](https://flatironschool.com/career-services-commitment/) (also referred to as the “CSC”) the way we did. If you stick to what we recommend you do in the CSC, you’ll be set up to get a job.


We’ll take you through units that cover every aspect of the job search, including:

  - Building a strong job search foundation
  - Writing resumes and cover letters
  - Creating your professional brand, including Linkedin, Twitter, GitHub, and blog
  - Networking effectively
  - Applying to jobs
  - Preparing for interviews (both technical and non-technical)
  - Communication best practices (via email, phone, and in-person)
  - Managing job offers
  - Continuing professional development
  
  
Take your time reading through this track, and whatever you do, don't rush through it. Everything that you will read and work on here will impact your job search in some way, and has been personally written by our team of Career Coaches with YOUR SUCCESS in mind. Similar to coding, job seeking is a skill that takes time to learn and practice. Refer back to different lessons in this track throughout your job search process as you need them, to build smart practices and optimize the results of your activities.


In addition to this content, you will be working with an individual Career Coach, as well as, the entire Career Services team. Your coach will set goals with you, hold you accountable to those goals, and will work with you for the next six months (or until you have a job offer).
